To use prisma
You start by installing it "npm i prisma @prisma/client"
After you write "npx prisma init"
You can always write your models in it
After that you write "npx prisma migrate dev --name CreateUsersTable"
NOTE: CreateUserTable is the name of the migration. It could be anything
Whenever you use the query in the backend, you use the '?' sign to call what you are querying, as in ?status=ACCEPTED
NOTE: As of now, the fulltext is only supported when using MySQL, it doesnt work with Postgres, SQLLite and MongoDB
